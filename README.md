# Thursday TED, Talk and Tapas (TTTT)

Have you ever felt after watching one or two TEDTalks that you want more? 

TEDTalks are an interesting format to drive folks to explore lots of ideas quickly, but not necessarily one that helps you either critique them or find ways of implementing them in your community.

TTTT is a format designed to encourage small groups of people to dig in more deeply on issues currated by and for specific communities. 

The format is designed to be flexible, easy to organize and repeatable. It is shared here under a Creative Commons License because we want people to experiment and contribute back to improve the idea.

This is a participatory event. You will be expected to engage with others who attend. 

Generally these events will be either organized by a sponsor, people will be asked for a suggested donation at the door or they will be charged prior to attending using tools like Eventbrite.

There may be experts in the room, but the starting point for everyone is what is presented in the videos. People should not feel that they need to watch the videos prior to attending.
